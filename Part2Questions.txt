1. Multiple devices are connected to the local network. For each one, list their MAC
address, IP address, and general purpose (personal computer, router, server, etc).

IPv4mcast_fb,	01:00:5e:00:00:fb, server
Cisco-Li_31:10:7c,	00:12:17:31:10:7c, router
Cisco_e8:18:00,	00:1f:6d:e8:18:00, router
IPv4mcast_fc,	01:00:5e:00:00:fc, server
IPv6mcast_01:00:03,	33:33:00:01:00:03, server
IPv6mcast_01:00:02,	33:33:00:01:00:02, server
IntelCor_50:f0:a6,	8c:a9:82:50:f0:a6, PC
Apple_d8:0f:fa,	04:0c:ce:d8:0f:fa, PC
Apple_e5:66:07,	00:26:08:e5:66:07, PC
IPv6mcast_0c,	33:33:00:00:00:0c, server
IPv4mcast_7f:ff:fa,	01:00:5e:7f:ff:fa, server

**There were so many IP addresses used throughout the course of the capture that we found it moot to include all of them**
**See Wireshark's Statistics for IPV_4 and IPV_6 all addresses**



2. One of the clients connects to an FTP server during the trace.
    a. What is the IP address and DNS hostname of the server it connects to?
	IP: 194.109.21.66, DNS Hostname: XS4ALL archive

    b. Based on the packet capture, what’s one major vulnerability of the FTP protocol?

    The FTP protocol has unencrypted information. (plaintext)

    c. Name at least two other common network protocols that can be used in place of
    FTP to provide secure file transfer.

    UDP and TCP

3. The trace shows that at least one of the clients makes HTTPS connections to sites other
than Facebook. Pick one of these connections and answer the following:
    a. What is the domain name of the site the client is connecting to?
	clients4.google.com
    b. Is there any way the HTTPS server can protect against the leak of domain name
    information from part (a)?
	No we would need encrypted DNS
	
    c. At the very beginning of an HTTPS, the client and server agree on a cipher suite
    to use and exchange encryption keys. How many cipher suites does the client
    support?
	Content Type: Change Cipher Spec (20)
    d. What cipher suite does the server choose for the connection?
	ECDH
    e. Who verified the server’s identity by signing their certificate?
	Google Internet Authority

4. One of the clients makes a number of requests to Facebook.
    a. Facebook processes logins over HTTPS, so that user’s passwords are
    encrypted. Despite this, what is insecure about the way that Facebook
    authenticates the user?

    Cookies in HTTPS are sent in transit over plaintext

    b. How could this allow an attacker to impersonate a user on Facebook?

    An attacker can use those cookies to access the account of which they correlate to

    c. How can this type of attack be prevented?

    Use a content-security-protocol that prevents attackers from seeing them.

    d. What did the user do on Facebook?

    They logged into their account and sent a message to someone.
